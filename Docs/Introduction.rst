**Introduction**
------------------- 
MeshView is one of several tools developed by the Human Brain Project
(HBP) with the aim of facilitating brain atlas based analysis and
integration of experimental data and knowledge about the human and
rodent brain.MeshView is a web application
for real-time 3D display of surface mesh data representing structural parcellations from volumetric atlases,
such as the Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain.

*Key features*:
  - orbiting view with toggleable opaque/transparent/hidden parcellation meshes
  - rendering user defined cut surface as if meshes were solid objects
  - rendering point-clouds (simple type-in, or loaded from a JSON format which is typically obtained from the QUINT workflow)
  - coordinate system is compatible with QuickNII (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/quicknii)

*Two atlases are provided with MeshView*:
  - Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat brain, parcellation version 2 (generated from 39 μm resolution volume)
  - Allen Mouse Brain Atlas reference atlas, CCFv3 parcellation from 2015 (generated from 25 μm resolution volume)
