**Introduction**
------------------- 
MeshView is one of several tools developed by the Human Brain Project
(HBP) with the aim of facilitating brain atlas based analysis and
integration of experimental data and knowledge about the human and
rodent brain.MeshView is a web application
for real-time 3D display of surface mesh data representing structural parcellations from volumetric atlases,
such as the Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain.

*Key features*:
  - orbiting view with toggleable opaque/transparent/hidden parcellation meshes
  - rendering user defined cut surface as if meshes were solid objects
  - rendering point-clouds (simple type-in, or loaded from a JSON format which is typically obtained from the nutil tool in the QUINT workflow)
  - coordinate system is compatible with QuickNII (https://quicknii.readthedocs.io)

.. tip:: 
   **MeshView can be used to visualize output from the QUINT workflow**
